# balena-compose

Complete toolkit to build docker-compose.yml files and optionally deploy them to balenaCloud.

Important: balena-compose is stable and perfectly usable but also, fundamentally, just a merge of several pre-existing different modules, that are merely re-exported from this one. You should expect a complete rewrite of the exported API in the medium term. What follows are pretty much the concatenated READMEs of these modules.
