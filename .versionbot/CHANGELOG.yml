    - subject: Use registry credentials to query image manifest
      hash: 9489eb4f7fb04c0abff676f5c397a8c6a2ac4e26
      body: |
        DockerHub rate limits for unauthenticated users are much smaller than
        even for free authenticated users. This can cause false negatives when
        querying the manifest if the host is being rate limited. Using the
        docker registry credentials when querying the manifest solves this.

      hash: 4178f93696438bc89415bbc260d3caf90a0b82bc
      body: |
        Similar to Manifest v2, OCI Image Index manifest types
        support the platform arg, and if the default host
        platform is not avilable in the manfiest they will
        actually fail to pull.
