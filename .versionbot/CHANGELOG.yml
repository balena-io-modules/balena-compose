    - subject: Create image contracts when creating release
      hash: 6bec3bb25f7f95f8912e41dc905af846e6f30250
      body: |
        This will use the contracts created from the composition (if any)
        to set the `contract` property in the release images.

        This requires passing a list of ImageDescriptors returned by
        `compose.parse` when calling release `create`. The list is required to
        avoid users creating a release without the contracts by mistake which
        makes this a breaking change.

      hash: babd4101761b10964e01cf4a922e75219d3debca
      body: |
        This option is not used by the [Docker
        API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.43/#tag/Image/operation/ImageCreate).

        As the cache can get really big, depending on how the cache list is
        obtained, this may mean sending a huge query string over the local
        network. There is good evidence to suggest that this could be the cause of
        balena-io/balena-cli#2165, which would cause the query string to over
        the 1MB limit set by [Golang's net/http server](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Server).

        This removes unnecessary queries to the registry for intermediate
        stage images in the dockerfile. Querying the registry for these images
        would fail in the best case or could cause false positives in the worst
        case.

        This commit adds an additional filter during parsing of the dockerfile
        to remove any intermediate stages from the query list.

      hash: 9489eb4f7fb04c0abff676f5c397a8c6a2ac4e26
      body: |
        DockerHub rate limits for unauthenticated users are much smaller than
        even for free authenticated users. This can cause false negatives when
        querying the manifest if the host is being rate limited. Using the
        docker registry credentials when querying the manifest solves this.
